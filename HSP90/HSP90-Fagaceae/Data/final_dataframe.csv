"Castanea crenata","Castanea crenata","Ccr1.0Fg0329.1","HSP 80-like","<i>Castanea crenata</i>, commonly known as the Japanese chestnut, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 m tall. It thrives in cool, non-calcareous soils and is primarily cultivated as an ornamental tree. Notably, it is resistant to chestnut blight, a disease that has devastated the American chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>). Its leaves, measuring 8 to 19 cm in length, are alternate, oblong-lanceolate, serrated, and pubescent on the underside. They are dark green in summer and turn yellowish-bronze in autumn. This species is monoecious, meaning each tree bears both male and female flowers. The flowers appear in late spring (May–June) in catkins, which are aromatic and creamy white to yellowish. Male flowers are positioned toward the upper part of the catkin, while female flowers are found near the base. The tree produces edible chestnuts, typically enclosed in groups of two or three within spiny, dehiscent husks. As they ripen, the husks turn yellowish and split open, revealing the chestnuts inside. Due to their high tannin content, these chestnuts have a bitter taste and are less favored compared to other varieties.","Ccr1.0Fg0329.1","6","Castanea","pfam00183 (PRK14083 superfamily)","705","MADTETFAFQAEINQLLSLIINTFYSNKEIFLRELISNASDALDKIRFESLTDKSKLDGQPELFIHIIPDKTNNTLTIIDSGIGMTKADLVNNLGTIARSGTKEFMEALAAGADVSMIGQFGVGFYSAYLVAEKVIVTAKHNDDEQYVWESQAGGSFTVTRDNSGEVLGRGTKITLYLKEDQLEYLEERRLKDLIKKHSEFISYPISLWIEKTTEKEISDDEDEEEKKDEEEKKDEEGKVEEIDEEKEKEEKKKKKIKEVSHEWSLVNKQKPIWMRKPEEIAKEEYAAFYKSLTNDWEEHLAVKHFSVEGQLEFKAILFAPKRAPFDLFDTRKKPNNIKLYVRRVFIMDNCEELIPEYLGFVKGIVDSEDLPLNISRETLQQNKILKVIRKNLVKKCIELFFEIAENKEDYAKFYEAFSKNLKLGIHEDSTNKTKLAELLRYHSTKSGEEMTSLKDYVTRMKEGQSDIYYITGESKKAVENSPFLEKLKKKGYEVLYMVDAIDEYAVGQLKEFEGKKLVSATKEGLKLDESEDEKKRQEELKAKFEGLCKVIKDVLGDKVEKVVVSDRVVDSPCCLVTGEYGWTANMERIMKAQALRDSSMAGYMSSKKTMEINPENSIMEELRKRADADKNDKSVKDLVLLLFETALLTSGFSLDEPNTFGNRIHRMLKLGLSIDEEAADGDAEMPPLEEADADAEGSKMEEVD"

"Castanea sativa","Castanea sativa","CSH1-5g25874","HSP 80","The European chestnut, or <i>Castanea sativa</i>, is a robust tree mainly found across the Mediterranean region and can reach a height of 35 m. Chestnut is an economically important tree used for both nut and wood production.

If the tree is wild, it has a compact, ellipsoidal crown, while grafted ones are wide and spherical. It has a moderately deep, extensive, and robust root system. In light or cultivated soils, the lateral roots spread across the entire area, while the growth of the taproot ceases as the crown stops growing in height.

The leaves are simple, alternate, and deciduous, with some marcescence. They have a short petiole, broadened at the branch insertion. The blade is oblong-lanceolate, prolonged into a fine point with a symmetrical base, reaching up to 25 cm. The underside of the leaves is pubescent, and the margins are regularly saw-toothed. The color of the leaves varies according to the variety.

This species is monoecious, meaning the same tree has both male and female flowers. The male flowers are grouped in clusters of 5–10, gathered in long catkins found at the ends of branches. Each male flower has 10–12 stamens. Female flowers are located at the base of the catkins and consist of a perianth with six bilobed lobes.

The fruits are formed by achenes at the base of the catkins, grouped in sets of up to three and covered by spiny bracts.

"Castanea sativa","Castanea sativa","CSH1-12g54964","HSP 83","The European chestnut, or <i>Castanea sativa</i>, is a robust tree mainly found across the Mediterranean region and can reach a height of 35 m. Chestnut is an economically important tree used for both nut and wood production.

If the tree is wild, it has a compact, ellipsoidal crown, while grafted ones are wide and spherical. It has a moderately deep, extensive, and robust root system. In light or cultivated soils, the lateral roots spread across the entire area, while the growth of the taproot ceases as the crown stops growing in height.

The leaves are simple, alternate, and deciduous, with some marcescence. They have a short petiole, broadened at the branch insertion. The blade is oblong-lanceolate, prolonged into a fine point with a symmetrical base, reaching up to 25 cm. The underside of the leaves is pubescent, and the margins are regularly saw-toothed. The color of the leaves varies according to the variety.

This species is monoecious, meaning the same tree has both male and female flowers. The male flowers are grouped in clusters of 5–10, gathered in long catkins found at the ends of branches.

"Quercus ilex","Quercus ilex","PQ.ilex-chr1","HSP 90-like","Evergreen tree, reaching up to 25 m in height. It possesses an axonomorphic and penetrating root system. Secondary roots have the ability to sprout shoots beneath the canopy.

It has simple, alternate, glabrous leaves, dark green on the upper side and whitish and very pubescent on the underside. They are orbicular or elliptical in shape, with edges ranging from entire to dentate-spiny. Leaves on shoots often have serrated or spiny edges, while those on the canopy typically have entire edges.

The holm oak is a monoecious species with unisexual flowers, but it tends towards dioecy as most specimens usually produce a greater quantity of flowers of one sex.

The fruit is an achene of variable size and shape, though it typically is oblong-cylindrical with an average length of 2.5 cm and a width of 1 cm, containing a single seed located on the inner wall of the shell.

Its leaves are simple, alternate, ovate in shape, and glossy green on the upper surface, while the underside is whitish. Their edges can be entire or sinuous and remotely denticulate. They can reach up to 8 cm in length and 4 cm in width.
This type of tree is monoecious (bearing both male and female flowers on the same tree). Male flowers form in catkins in the form of a cluster up to 6 cm long, hairy, initially erect and red, then hanging and yellow. Female flowers are solitary or in small groups.
The fruit is an acorn of variable shape, with a conical cup and elongated scales.","LOC136061380","Unkwon","Quercus","pfam00183 (PRK14083 superfamily)","611","MNIGGYIVDSGVGLGVLRIVFLILISSTLLVSLYDVIVVVSTKSPKSDKQYVWEGEANASSYTIREETDPEKLLPRGTRLTLHLKRDDKGFAHPERIQKLVKNYSQFVSFPIYTWQEKGFTKEVEVDEDPAETKKDGQDEQSEKKKKTKTVVEKYWDWELTNETQPIWLFIFAASQPKEVTTEEYNEFYKKTFNEYLDPLASSHFTTEGEVEFRSILYVPAIAPMGKDDIVNPKTKNIRLYVKRVFISDDFDGELFPRYLSFVKGVVDSNDLPLNVSREILQESRIVRIMRKRLVRKAFDMILGISMSENKDDYDRFWENFGKHLKLGCIEDRENHKRIAPLLRFLSSQSVDELISLDEYVENMKPEQKDIYYMAADSVTSARNTPFLERLLEKDLEVLFLVDPIDEVAIQNLKAYKEKNFVDISKEDLDLGDKNEEKDKEIKQEFGQTCDWIKKHLGDKVASVQISNRLSSSPCVLVSGKFGWSANMERLMKAQSAGDTSSLDFMRGRRVFEINPGHPIIRNLNAACKSNPNDEDAQKAIDLLYDAALVSSGFTPENPAQLGGKIYEMMDIALSGKWSTPIEVQHPGAISNNTETVEAEVVEPVEAGGQK"
